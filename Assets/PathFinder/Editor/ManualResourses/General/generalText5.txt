<b>Important:</b> There is size, not end position. So if you want for example chunks from 5, 5 to 15, 15 you should enter 5, 5 and 10, 10

   Add Component "PathFinderAgent" to your desired target and put created AgentProperties in it. This is class to control your Agent and receive data from NavMesh. Now you can start requesting data by using <b>SetGoalMoveHere, SetGoalFindCover, SetGoalGetBattleGrid</b>. After that agent start to receive requested data into <b>path, covers, battleGrid</b> accessors. Also you can add delegates to execute when it resive requested information using <b>SetRecievePathDelegate, SetRecieveBattleGridDelegate, SetRecieveCoverDelegate</b>. This class does not implement any movement at all. You should implement movement youself. Read more about it in "Agent and Properties" tab.
<b>Important:</b> Information are can be requested without builded NavMesh. If no NavMesh exist in target area then PathFinder will create it anyway. For SetGoalMoveHere it create bunch of NavMesh's in a straight line to goal.
