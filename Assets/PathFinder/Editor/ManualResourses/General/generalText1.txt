<b><size=20>Overview</size></b>

   Hi there! This is K-Pathfinder. A tool to generate navigation mesh in a grid pattern and some additional data. And possibly navigate your stuff through it. Was designed with goal in mind to use it in procedural shooter-like world. It's provided "as is" and I take no responsibility if it break something or if you lose something.  


Features:
 * Open source
 * Multiple types of agent
 * Generate navmesh in runtime
 * Remove and add chunks of navmesh in runtime
 * Areas with different move cost. Also areas can be readed from Unity terrain splat map
 * Areas with different passability. Current is "walking" and "crouching" 
 * Covers. Low and high
 * Grid. For providing bunch of world space points wich can be reachable from target position
 * Jump spots to move up and down (works kinda bad. object to change)
 * Navmesh Raycasting
 * Dynamic Obstacles

   <b>1)</b> Create agent properties. Button to create agent properties are located in "Window / K-PathFinder / Create Agent Properties".
